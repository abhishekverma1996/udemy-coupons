Revit is 4D building information modeling application capable with tools to plan and track various stages in the building's lifecycle, from concept to construction and later maintenance and/or demolition.</p><p>Take your Revit skills to the Advanced level. First, get comfortable with the Revit environment, and learn to set up a project and add the grids, levels, and dimensions that will anchor your design. Then we dive into modeling: adding walls, doors, and windows; creating and mirroring groups; linking to DWG files; and working with floors, roofs, and ceilings. I will also shows advanced techniques for modeling stairs and complex walls, adding rooms, and creating schedules. Finally, discover how to annotate your drawing so all the components are perfectly understood, and learn how to output sheets to PDF and AutoCAD.</p><p>Finally i will also covers basics to Intermediate level of dynamo in Revit.</p><p>Herewith I had created many videos for civil engineering students &amp; professionals in order to learn concepts &amp; softwares practically. </p><p>In this Course you can learn following most demanded civil engineering softwares from very basic level to advanced level. </p><p>AutoCAD 2D </p><p>AutoCAD 3D, </p><p>Revit Architecture,</p><p>Revit Structure, </p><p>Revit MEP</p><p>Revit Dynamo, </p><p>Staad Pro, </p><p>Etabs, </p><p>Revit to Lumion Pro, </p><p>Preliminary Designs of Structural Members, </p><p>Leaning Bar Bending Schedule with AutoCAD &amp; Excel, </p><p>Quantity Surveying / Building Estimation with AutoCAD &amp; Excel, </p><p>AutoCAD Raster Design, </p><p>Introduction to ISO Global BIM Standards</p><p><br></p><p>With Warm Regards,</p><p>Ashish Pandit </p><p>B.E.

Revit is 4D building information modeling application capable with tools to plan and track various stages in the building's lifecycle, from concept to construction and later maintenance and/or demolition.</p><p>Take your Revit skills to the Advanced level. First, get comfortable with the Revit environment, and learn to set up a project and add the grids, levels, and dimensions that will anchor your design. Then we dive into modeling: adding walls, doors, and windows; creating and mirroring groups; linking to DWG files; and working with floors, roofs, and ceilings. I will also shows advanced techniques for modeling stairs and complex walls, adding rooms, and creating schedules. Finally, discover how to annotate your drawing so all the components are perfectly understood, and learn how to output sheets to PDF and AutoCAD.</p><p>Finally i will also covers basics to Intermediate level of dynamo in Revit.</p><p>Herewith I had created many videos for civil engineering students &amp; professionals in order to learn concepts &amp; softwares practically. </p><p>In this Course you can learn following most demanded civil engineering softwares from very basic level to advanced level. </p><p>AutoCAD 2D </p><p>AutoCAD 3D, </p><p>Revit Architecture,</p><p>Revit Structure, </p><p>Revit MEP</p><p>Revit Dynamo, </p><p>Staad Pro, </p><p>Etabs, </p><p>Revit to Lumion Pro, </p><p>Preliminary Designs of Structural Members, </p><p>Leaning Bar Bending Schedule with AutoCAD &amp; Excel, </p><p>Quantity Surveying / Building Estimation with AutoCAD &amp; Excel, </p><p>AutoCAD Raster Design, </p><p>Introduction to ISO Global BIM Standards</p><p><br></p><p>With Warm Regards,</p><p>Ashish Pandit </p><p>B.E.
